# Poker-Player

As a poker fan who has introduced many of my friends to the game, I decided to make this tool to help newcomers and experienced players alike easily and visually demonstrate different aspects of the game. By clearly displaying the parts of the game, the cards involved and the different types of hands, this tool is an easy way to provide examples of poker hands.

It's extremely simple to use, over any card enter its value and suit in order for the card to be visible, but you don't even need both in order for the tool to work! Based on the user's input, the tool displays the current winner of the poker hand and the hand with which they're winning as well, giving an easy and fun way to simulate poker hands.
